    <h2>Who is Frontend Developer</h2>
    <p>
      A Frontend Developer is a programmer who builds the part of a website or
      app that users see and interact with. They use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
      to create layouts, styles, and interactivity.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Their job is to turn designs into responsive, user-friendly pages. They
      also work with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue to make websites
      faster, interactive, and visually appealing.
